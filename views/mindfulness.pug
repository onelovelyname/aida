        h2 Mindfulness and peacebuilding
        p
          | We believe that mindfulness and the recognition of our interbeing as human beings is the path to peace.
          | We practice with the intention of opening our hearts to the reality of what is,
          | looking deeply to identify appropriate response, and acting with love and authenticity
          | towards greater peace in ourselves and in the world.
