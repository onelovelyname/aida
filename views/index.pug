            | During summer camp with 25 children from Aida and Dheisheh refugee camps,
            | we imagined a future where children could play in a safe and friendly environment,
            | where young people could find choice and opportunity in education,
            | and all could take refuge in harmonious, loving community.

              | Our long-term vision is to build a trade school for Palestinian young people,
              | providing them with free exposure and access to skills that can offer remote employment in the global marketplace.
              | These skills include software engineering, web design, social media, and marketing.
              | We’ve started with two pilot programs in the Bethlehem area.

              | We believe in the resiliency and strength of the Palestinian community.
              | In our work in the West Bank and Arab communities of Haifa,
              | we’ve witnessed the individual and collective ability to persist through conflict.
              | We build upon these strengths in teaching the Community Resiliency Model (CRM), body-based tools
              | developed in California and used throughout the world to bring the body back into balance after trauma.

              | towards greater peace in ourselves and in the world.
